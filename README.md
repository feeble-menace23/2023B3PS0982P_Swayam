Q1) Write a Python program that prints the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.

Q2) Write a Python function that takes a list of strings and returns the string with the most vowels.

Q3) Write a function to find the second largest element in a list without using the built-in sorted() function.

Q4) Implement a function to remove duplicates from a list without using any built-in Python data structures like sets.

Q5) Question: Write a Python function that takes two lists as arguments and returns a new dictionary where the keys are the elements from the first list, and the values are the corresponding elements from the second list.
For example, if the input lists are keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty'] and values = [10, 20, 30], the output should be {'Ten': 10, 'Twenty': 20, 'Thirty': 30}.

Q6) Write a program to print the following pattern using loops.
            1  

         1  2  

      1  2  3  

   1  2  3  4

Q7) Write a Python function that takes a time input in the format "hh:mm" (24-hour notation) as a string and calculates the shorter angle between the hour and minute hands of an analog clock.
For the input "12:30" the angle between them is 165 degrees.
